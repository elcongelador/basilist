#NEXT

#TODO
- lists / couchdb: let user register different views for one list (db.nim: registerList)
- create error handling for requests querying inexistent lists

#TODO MAYBE
- in agent.nim for updates: change from post to put - to reflect CouchDB API

#DONE
- return id and rev we got from couch for inserts to basilist clients

#NOTES
- strange: order of functions in file db.nim (three versions of each query / insert / update / delete) is important,
with the wrong order we run into recursive calls between them
